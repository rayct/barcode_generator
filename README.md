## Generate Barcode using Python

## Dependencies

### pip install python-barcode

## This is a Python code snippet that generates a barcode image in PNG format using the barcode package. Here's how it works: 
1. The user is prompted to input the code that they want to generate a barcode for.

2. The barcode.get_barcode_class() function is used to get the class corresponding to the desired barcode format. In this case, we're using the Universal Product Code (UPC) format.

3. The barcode_format() function is called with the code and the ImageWriter() class to create a Barcode object.

4. Finally, the save() method is called on the Barcode object to save the generated barcode as a PNG image with the filename "generated_barcode.png".

## Note! that before running this code, you will need to install the barcode package. You can do this by running pip install python-barcode.
