## Generate Barcode using Python

## Note! that before running this code, you will need to install the barcode package dependencies.
## You can do this by running: pip install python-barcode.

### This is a Python code snippet that generates a barcode image in PNG format using the barcode package. Here's how it works:

## Version: 1.0.1: Updated Code with error handling.

### With this error handling code, the program will inform the user about any input errors that occur and prompt them to enter a valid code.

### The code in version: 1.0 seems to be correct, however it may produce some errors depending on the input provided by the user.
### Here are some possible errors that may occur:

1. If the user inputs a non-numeric string as the code, the program will raise a ValueError when the barcode_format() function is called.
### This is because the UPC format only accepts numeric codes.

2. If the user inputs a code that is too long or too short for the UPC format,
### The program will raise a barcode.errors.IllegalCharacterError or a barcode.errors.NumberOfDigitsError, respectively.

### To handle these errors, you can wrap the barcode_format() call in a try-except block and provide appropriate error messages to the user.


## Version: 1.0
1. The user is prompted to input the code that they want to generate a barcode for.

2. The barcode.get_barcode_class() function is used to get the class corresponding to the desired barcode format. In this case, we're using the Universal Product Code (UPC) format.

3. The barcode_format() function is called with the code and the ImageWriter() class to create a Barcode object.

4. Finally, the save() method is called on the Barcode object to save the generated barcode as a PNG image with the filename "generated_barcode.png".
